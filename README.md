# pic16f877a_interfacing
This repository consists of interfacing various peripherals with pic16f877a microcontroller along with its simulation file
# Requirements:
MPLab software

Proteus for simulation

# Working
Each pheripheral interfacing with microcontroller is done by programming the micronctroller in Embedded C language to accordingly drive the specific device being integrated with the microncontroller
All the specification and register configuration can be viewd in the dataset of the microcontroller provided by the manufacturer-https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/devicedoc/39582b.pdf

Here in this repository i would like to share all the possible interfaces with the microcontroller
